\begin{itemize}
    \item WERs of from scratch (32.1\% and 36.6\%) and in-house supervised pretraining (31.9\% and 36.9\%) reduce to (31.4\% and 33.4\%) of in-house pretraining 
    \\ \textrightarrow \, 
    On \textbf{wav2vec 2.0} architecture, the unsupervised pretraining helps 
    %\TODO{we don't have a control experiment where we trained longer thatn 33 epochs without pre-training, right?}
    
    \item WERs reduce from 31.4\% and 33.4\% to 31.0\% and 32.3\% 
    \\ \textrightarrow \,
    Data augmentation for pretraining is helpful
    
    \item WERs of Youtube data (29.8\% and 35.2\%) vs. in-house data (31.4\% and 33.4\%) 
    \\ \textrightarrow \,
    Having more data is not always helpful, if the domain mismatch is larger and the data has less speakers
    
    \item WERs by 25.3\% and 27.2\% when combining the in-house and YT data (the best result using solely monolingual data)
    \\ \textrightarrow \,
    Diversity of domains and speakers is necessary

%\TODO{these points need to be discussed with the table in view. so you need to say these things when you are showing the table, and then you can give a summary on the following slide}
