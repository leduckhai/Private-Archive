\caption{
    \glspl{WER} {[}\%{]} comparison of On-off Regularization technique over epochs for raw waveform from scratch training.
    "Off Regularization" stage means training without regularization techniques like Dropout, SpecAugment and \glsxtrshort{IF Loss}.
    After training for some first epochs, the learning rate is reset and the model is preloaded in the "On Regularization" stage (all regularization techniques are turned on).
    All models are then continued being finetuned until full convergence on Vietnamese in-house data and recognized on HYKIST dataset.
    The 3rd row (0 epoch for "Off Regularization") is the baseline.}
